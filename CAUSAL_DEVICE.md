# CaPU as a Causal Device

Principles are causes.
Meaning is the trace.
Actions are side effects.

## Why “execute first, justify later” creates burnout
When execution happens before causality, systems accumulate unowned effects.
This produces overload, blame shifting, and a loss of agency.
CaPU prevents this by requiring causes to be explicit, committed, and attributable.

## Why HOLD is a first-class state
HOLD is not a failure. It is the device honoring time, dependencies, and readiness.
A cause can be valid and still not mature enough to execute.
This preserves integrity and prevents premature or unsafe effects.

## Why children and people do not act without cause
Human action is guided by reasons, context, and accountability.
When reasons are absent or unclear, hesitation is a form of self-protection.
CaPU mirrors this: it requires a cause before any effect is permitted.
